PagePeek is a lightweight Flask API that fetches the `<title>` tag of any provided webpage URL. Itâ€™s designed to power blog systems (like yours) that need to convert plain URLs into rich, clickable links with actual page titles.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ”— Fetches the `<title>` of any webpage.

- âš¡ In-memory + SQLite caching to avoid redundant requests.

- ðŸ›¡ Handles errors gracefully (invalid URLs, timeouts, etc.).

- ðŸ”Œ Easy to integrate with any frontend (React, etc.).

- ðŸª„ Hosted easily on PythonAnywhere or any Flask-friendly platform.

## API

- **POST /get-title**

      ```

âœ… Caches titles in SQLite to reduce duplicate fetches.
